# 4thSemester_website

This is my final 4th semester project for the IT Technology programme. 

I am developing a business website from scratch, using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), PHP, SQL and JavaScript. 

The purpose of this project is to make the business (handmade event decorating) more reachable and accessible by having its own website. 

On the website the customer can see the portfolio of the work, order available decorations, ask for custom commissions etc.

The goal is to develop a modern minimalistic website that is 100% responsive, easy to navigate and user friendly, while going along the client's requirements, expectations and suggestions. 

The website features an "e-shop" with products for sale and shopping cart.
